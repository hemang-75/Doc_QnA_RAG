The committee also decided to remain focused on the withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth. The standing deposit facility (SDF) rate and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate, along with the Bank Rate, were also kept unchanged at 6.25% and 6.75% respectively. The MPC's decisions were aimed at achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4% within a band of +/- 2%, while also supporting economic growth.\n",

      "*** Bot Response *** :  Between the meetings held in February 2023 and February 2024, the Monetary Policy Committee's assessment of the Global and Domestic Economy showed some differences in outlook and emphasis:\n",
      "\n",
      "**February 2023:**\n",
      "- **Global Economy:** There was an improvement in the global growth outlook despite ongoing geopolitical tensions and the impact of monetary policy tightening across the world. Global growth was expected to decelerate in 2023, with inflation showing some softening from elevated levels. Central banks were expected to continue their efforts to bring inflation closer to their targets, amidst volatile bond yields and financial markets.\n",
      "- **Domestic Economy:** India's GDP growth for 2022-23 was placed at 7.0% year-on-year, driven by private consumption and investment. Economic activity remained strong in the third and fourth quarters of 2022-23, with high-frequency indicators suggesting robust performance. The supply side saw a GVA estimate of 6.7%.\n",
      "\n",
      "**February 2024:**\n",
      "- **Global Economy:** Global growth was expected to remain steady in 2024 after a resilient performance in the previous year. Inflation was edging down from multi-decade highs, with financial market sentiments fluctuating due to changing views on central banks' policies in advanced economies. Emerging market economies faced currency fluctuations amidst volatile capital flows.\n",
      "- **Domestic Economy:** The domestic economic activity was strengthening, with real GDP expected to grow by 7.3% year-on-year in 2023-24, underpinned by strong investment activity. The supply side saw a GVA expansion of 6.9% in 2023-24, with manufacturing and services sectors being key drivers. The outlook for 2024-25 was positive, supported by recovery in rabi sowing, sustained profitability in manufacturing, and resilience of services.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Comparison:**\n",
      "- The global economic outlook was cautiously optimistic in both years, with concerns about geopolitical tensions, monetary policy impacts, and inflation. However, the tone in 2024 suggests a steadier global growth expectation and a more pronounced focus on the moderation of inflation.\n",
      "- Domestically, the emphasis shifted from strong economic activity and the role of private consumption and investment in 2023 to a more detailed outlook on growth drivers for 2024, including investment activity, manufacturing, and services sectors' performance. The growth forecast for 2023-24 was slightly higher than the previous year, indicating an improvement in economic conditions.\n",

      "*** Bot Response *** :  The key decisions and points from the April 2023 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Policy Rates Unchanged**: The MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 percent. Similarly, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains at 6.25 percent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Focus on Inflation and Growth**: The committee resolved to remain focused on the withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth. This decision aligns with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 percent within a band of +/- 2 percent, also while supporting growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Unanimous Voting**: All members of the MPC unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 percent. However, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma expressed reservations about the part of the resolution focusing on the withdrawal of accommodation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Inflation and Economic Activity**: The MPC noted the moderation in CPI headline inflation into the tolerance band, reflecting the impact of monetary tightening and supply-augmenting measures. Despite a projected decline in headline inflation for 2023-24 from its level in 2022-23, it would still be above the target, necessitating continuous vigilance. The progress of the south-west monsoon was highlighted as critical in this regard.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Economic Resilience and Outlook**: Domestic economic activity is holding up well, with improving consumer confidence and optimistic business outlooks. The cumulative rate hike of 250 basis points undertaken by the MPC since May 2022 is transmitting through the economy, expected to contain inflationary pressures in the coming months.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Future Actions**: The MPC resolved to continue keeping a close vigil on the evolving inflation and growth outlook, ready to take further monetary actions promptly and appropriately as required to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored and to bring down inflation to the target.\n",
